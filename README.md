# machine-learning-python

The code found in here was written while completing the udemy course "Machine Learning Komplettkurs mit Python" by Jan Schaffranek. Unless otherwise stated in the files the code is a reproduction of what was tought in the course. It is **not** a clone of the code, it is the content of the course in my own style and probably some improvements.
